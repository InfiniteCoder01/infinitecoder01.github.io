# Writing a compiler backend for my programming language in ðŸ¦€

This all started when I decided to make my own language. Again.

I wanted to make a rust-like language with an effect system and some more
features. You can see it on [github](https://github.com/InfiniteCoder01/Trustlang).

I\'ve tried many approaches, but settled on tokenizing text â†’ parsing it into an AST â†’
building an Intermediate Representation (IR) from this AST â†’ converting this IR into
raw bytes â†’ packaging those bytes into an application like ELF or PE.

The first problem I encountered with the backend itself is compiling to x86\_64.
That\'s the first architecture I\'ve tried to implement and already got stuck.
Turns out that x86\_64 instruction set is really difficult (THIS IS ALL ABOUT
LEGACY and BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!!!). It has some weird things like REX (register extensions)
or some shortcuts (For example `add AL, 5` is taking 2 bytes (encoded as `04 05`) when
`add BL, 5` takes 3 bytes (encoded as `80 c3 05`))

I have found this great page as reference for x86\_64 opcodes: [X86-64 Instruction Encoding](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/hsn/chm/x86.chm/x64.htm)
([OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding) is basically the same page)
[This](https://shell-storm.org/x86doc/) table also helped me a lot.

When I did some first steps with x86\_64, I had to pack it into some sort of executable,
which turned out a big challange. I couldn\'t find any rust crates that will write
elf executables, only ones that write relocatibles and I want to integrate a linker into
my backend. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC1U1LJQL8o) video helped me
A LOT with reading/writing elf files. But be aware: it has some wrong types! For example (the only one I found)
sizes in program header. Check [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) for that!

When I\'ve implemented a minimal functionality for my elf crate, I\'ve tried to compile a simple program
and got segmentation fault. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH6jDiKxod8) helped me finally figure it
out. Essentially entry point has some strict rules.
Finally, I released this crate: [orecc-elf](https://crates.io/crates/orecc-elf)
